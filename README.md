Creating a new project which will enable users to create a workout, and then save them to a central repository. This will then allow users to also share them with friends and ohter users.

This project was previously started with Parse a while ago, but since Facebook is no longer supporting Parse, I will be switching to Firebase, and eventually my own Restful API. 

This project is very early in development and I am testing out using Firebase with the 3.0 release.

This project will be using:

UI:

  Rx Java/Android
  
  ButterKnife 8
  
  
  Dagger 2 
  
  Retrofit 2.0 (If I change to a restful API)
  
  FireBase Authenticaion
  
  Firebase Database
  Firebase Analytics
  Firebase Everything because why not

Testing:

Espresso

Mockito

Cappucino
